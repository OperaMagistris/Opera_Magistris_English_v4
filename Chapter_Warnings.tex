	\subsection{How to use this book}
	At the university level, this book can be used for a PhD, graduate level or advanced undergraduate level seminar in various exact and pure fields of science. In reality this books also aims to cover the full Kindergarten to PhD curriculum.

	\end{figure}
	Because the methods of Applied Mathematics are learned by practice and experience, we view a seminar on Applied Mathematics as a learning-by-doing (project oriented) seminar. We structure our mathematical modelling seminars around a set of problems that require the trainee to construct models that help with planning and decision making. The imperative is that the models should be consistent with the theory and back-tested. To fulfil this imperative, it is necessary for the trainee to combine mathematical theory with modelling. The result is that the trainee learns the theory, and more importantly, learns how that theory is applied and combined in the real world. The ability to criticize and identify limitations of dangerous mathematical tools is the most valuable feature of our seminars.

	The problems with solutions in this book provide the opportunity to apply the text material to a comprehensive set of fairly realistic situations. By the end of the seminars the trainees will have enhanced their skills and knowledge of the most important theoretical and computing tools. These are valuable skills that are in demand by the businesses at the highest levels.

	It is very difficult to cover all the material in this book in a semester. It takes a lot of time to explain the concepts to the trainees. The reader is encouraged to pick and choose which topics will be covered during the term. It is not necessary strictly necessary to cover them in sequence but it can help in a significant way?

	In a nutshell, this book offers you a wide variety of topics that are amenable to modelling. All are practical.
	
	\subsubsection{Style guide}
	We use a few standard conventions throughout these book. They were prepared  obviously with \LaTeX{} which automatically numbers sections and the hyperref package provides links within the PDF for the Table of Contents as well as other references made within the body of the text.

	We use color and some boxes to set apart some points for convenient reference. In particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clickable links and cross-references are most of time in magenta (only a few special cases are in blue)
		
		\item Texts expliciting the target of cross-references are in light grey 
		
		\item New terms (most of time associated with definitions) are in red
		
		\item Remarks are in greyed out boxes
		
		\item Examples are in black bordered boxes
		
		\item Proofs start with the word "proof" and are concluded with a $\blacksquare$
		
		\item Supplementary examples\footnote{A companion example to a theorem doesn't have any specific symbol} start with the symbol {\Large \ding{45}}
	\end{itemize}
	Doubtless, we have failed to live up to our legalism somewhere. If the reader keep a list of these transgressions to give it to us at the end of the reading of this book it would be very likely worthwhile for the redactors.
	
	\subsubsection{Credits}
	The redactors have attempted (because the lack of answer is often the rule rather than the exception...) to credit and obtain the necessary authorizations for the use of any material protected by copyright, such as photographs, animations, videos and illustrations from third-party sources.

	If, however, copyright infringement is unintentionally committed, we encourage copyright owners to contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
	
	\subsubsection{Videos and Animations}
	This book contains a dozens of small videos and animations integrated inside the PDF pages themselves. However to be able to play them you will need:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Adobe Flash Player for Firefox - NPAPI (the latest version if this technology still exists when you read these lines...)
		
		\item To activate the following option available in most Adobe PDF readers on Microsoft Windows:
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{img/intro/adobe_reader_multimedia.jpg}
		\end{center}
		This option needs to be reactivate each time you close and reopen the reader depending on your IT policy.
	\end{enumerate}

	Copyright (C) 12000 (holocene calendar) Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
	\end{center}

	\subsection{Preamble} 

	The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it only a non-commercial purpose\footnote{The immediate benefit of this is that you can generate the book, with brand new  problem sets, and distribute it to your students simply as a PDF (in an email, for instance). But more generally, if you are not keen on the way we explained (or failed to explain) something, then you are free to rewrite it. If you would like to cover more (or less) material, then you are free to add (or delete) whatever Chapters/Sections/Paragraphs
that you wish. And since we can provide the source code on request, the reader do not need to recreate the wheel.}. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

	This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. 

	We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 

	\subsection{Applicability and Definitions}
	This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". 

	A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 

	A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 

	The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. 

	The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. 

	A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is named "Opaque". 

	Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only. 

	The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 

	\subsection{Verbatim Copying} 
	You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 

	You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 

	\subsection{Copying in Quantity}

	If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 

	If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 

	If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. 

	It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 

	\subsection{Modifications}

	You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the Change Log section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 

		\item List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). 

		\item State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 

		\item Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 

		\item Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 

		\item Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 

		\item Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 

		\item Include an unaltered copy of this License. 

		\item Preserve the section entitled "Change Log", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "Change Log" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 

		\item Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "Change Log" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 

		\item In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 

		\item Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 

		\item Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 

		\item Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

		\item If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. 

		\item You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. 

		\item You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. 

		\item The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
	\end{itemize} 

	\subsection{Combining Documents}
	You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. 

	The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. 

	In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "Change Log" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "Change Log"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements." 

	\subsection{Collections of Documents}
	You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. 

	You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 

	\subsection{Aggregation with independent Works} 
	A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is named an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. 

	If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 
	
	\subsection{Generating this document}
	You will need four things to generate this document for yourself:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Install \href{https://miktex.org/}{MiKTeX}

		\item Install \href{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index_fr.html}{TeXMaker}

		\item An internet connection

		\item Configure MikTeX as indicated in the remarks at the beginning of the \textit{LaTeX\_SciencesCh\_EN.tex} file
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Translation}
	Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of the corresponding section about transformation. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License.

	\section{Roadmap (To Do)}
	This book has a simple progression rule that is: $1$ new A4 page per day since May 12001 (holocene calendar) on subjects that interest the supervisor of the \textit{Original} distribution of the book \textit{Opera Magistris}.
