When arriving at the three thousandth A4 page of writing this book and at the occasion of the 4th edition, it seemed appropriate to us to try to give a rough timeline of the majority of subjects mentioned in this book\footnote{Even if for some dates it is not possible to check if they are legends or real facts...}. This gives a better perspective on the tools used and also to pay tribute to our illustrious predecessors whom we owe our quality of life, our longevity, our mastery of the environment (not necessarily its respect...) and of its understanding.

If there are important dates missing (but only on subjects near of those presented in the various sections of this book!) or that you identify errors, do not hesitate to let us know, it is a first draft, and therefore this chronology can only be improved.

For more information the reader may refer to \href{http://www.wikipedia.com}{{\color{blue} Wikipedia}}, which has reached the top level in the number of available historical dates and in quality (with verification of sources!).

The reader will notice that as for the biggest part of this book, the years below are given on the basis of the Holocene scientific calendar and not on the basis of one of the many religious calendars (based on fairy tales and legends) existing in the world and this for obvious reasons...

The mathematician and geometer Euclid published his \textit{Elements}, where he reorganized the entire knowledge of the geometry including logical proofs, the construction of the $5$ Platonic solids. In his \textit{Optica} he noted that the light goes in a straight line and describes the law of reflection. We have also that the conical, elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic concepts appears in the works of two mathematicians of the ancient Greece, namely Menaech-mus and Appolonius de Perge that also introduces the concept of tangent. The same period Bhagabati Sutra calculates the permutations and combinations of order $1$, $2$ and $3$.

In Hindu cosmology, the Manusmriti (1.67–80) and Puranas describe time as cyclical, with a new universe (planets and life) created by Brahma every 8.64 billion years. The universe is created, maintained, and destroyed within a kalpa (day of Brahma) period lasting for 4.32 billion years, and is followed by a pralaya (night) period of partial dissolution equal in duration. In some Puranas (e.g. Bhagavata Purana), a larger cycle of time is described where matter (mahat-tattva or universal womb) is created from primal matter (prakriti) and root matter (pradhana) every 622.08 trillion years, from which Brahma is born. The elements of the universe are created, used by Brahma, and fully dissolved within a maha-kalpa (life of Brahma; 100 of his 360-day years) period lasting for 311.04 trillion years containing 36,000 kalpas (days) and pralayas (nights), and is followed by a maha-pralaya period of full dissolution equal in duration. The texts also speak of innumerable worlds or universes.

The philosopher Aristotle develops the logic with a theory of naive proposals, quantities and inferential reasoning. He also wrote a treatise on meteorology named \textit{Meteorologica}. It is crystal clear from this treatise that he already understood the cycle of water and knew that clouds were made of evaporated water and are therefore very heavy structures. He also knew (in a naive way) and tested experimentally how salt water and normal water were separated and mixed in the seas.  Aristotle pioneered scientific method alongside his empirical biology and his work on logic, rejecting a purely deductive framework in favour of generalisations made from observations of nature. Aristotle mentioned also that salt water (of the sea) was heavier and more dense than fresh water, and salt water would seek a lower level.

The philosopher Democritus of Abdera advance the idea that matter is composed of tiny and identical particles that he named "atoms". In reality it is rather an extension of the ideas of his teacher, the philosopher Leucippus of Miletus developed ten years before. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, would have given what is probably the first rigorous proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$. The proof uses a Reductio ad absurdum reasoning to show that the sides of a square are incommensurable with its diagonal.

The oldest known record of the Camera Obscura is a description by Han Chinese philosopher Mozi (ca. 9530 to ca. 9609).  Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.

The philosophers Leucippus and Democritus are the founders of atomism. Yajnavalkya, in his \textit{Shatapatha Brahmana}, describes the motions of the Sun and the Moon, and advances a 95-year cycle to synchronize the motions of the Sun and the Moon. 

Period of earliest documented mention of the concept of spherical Earth dates from around the 95th century, when it appears in the writings of Greek philosophers. In the 93th, Hellenistic astronomy established the roughly spherical shape of Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth's circumference. This knowledge was gradually adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

The philosopher Empedocles of Acragas calls for decomposition of the world into four fundamentals elements: water, earth, air and fire.

Greek philosophers, as early as Anaximander, introduce the idea of multiple or even infinite universes. Democritus further detailed that these worlds varied in distance, size; the presence, number and size of their suns and moons; and that they are subject to destructive collisions. Also during this time period, the Greeks established that the Earth is spherical rather than flat.

Sulbar Sutras of Manava finds irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{61}$ and agrees to use irrational numbers in his calculations. The first known university (using strictly the definition of that word which is derived from the Latin \textit{universitas magistrorum et scholarium}, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars") was created at Miletus (where Thales studied). Notice that the word "universiy" seems to exist since only the 113 century.

In approximately 8705 a new hieroglyphic word appeared. Bia-n-pet literally translates as “iron from the sky”. The new word was applied to all metallic iron from this time onwards. An obvious explanation for the sudden emergence of the new word would be a major event, such as a large impact or shower of meteorites, witnessed by the ancient Egyptian population. This would have left little uncertainty as to where exactly the mysterious iron came from, and would have created a sufficiently strong association between iron and the sky for the new word to become synonymous with all forms of iron. In 12008 a large impact crater formed by an iron meteorite was found in southern Egypt. Although its exact age is unknown, local archaeology suggests that it formed within the last 5000 years, making it a possible candidate event.

The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient Babylonians, who developed a positional number system that greatly aided them in solving their rhetorical algebraic equations. The Babylonians were not interested in exact solutions, but rather approximations, and so they would commonly use linear interpolation to approximate intermediate values. One of the most famous tablets is the Plimpton 322 tablet, created around 8100-8400, which gives a table of Pythagorean triples and represents some of the most advanced mathematics prior to Greek mathematics. Babylonian algebra was much more advanced than the Egyptian algebra of the time; whereas the Egyptians were mainly concerned with linear equations the Babylonians were more concerned with quadratic and cubic equations. The Babylonians had developed flexible algebraic operations with which they were able to add equals to equals and multiply both sides of an equation by like quantities so as to eliminate fractions and factors. They were familiar with many simple forms of factoring, three-term quadratic equations with positive roots, and many cubic equations, although it is not known if they were able to reduce the general cubic equation.
